# Image Recognition

This project implements Superpharm logo recognition without using OpenCV image processing methods (OpenCV was used only for reading and displaying image).

# Implementation

* reading image from file
* segmentation based on color range
* morphological operations - open and close to enhance binary mask
* separating objects using connected components algorithm
* calculating M1 for objects bigger than specific value
* calculating distance between recognised components of the logo
* decision werther logo is found on the image

# Technology
* C ++
